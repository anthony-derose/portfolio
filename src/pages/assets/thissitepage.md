### this site. 

The codebase for this website can be found here: [https://github.com/anthony-derose/my-portfolio-website](https://github.com/anthony-derose/my-portfolio-website). 

This website was made using a mix of technologies and frameworks such as ReactJS, CSS, HTML, Markdown and Bootstrap. 

This is one of my first real attempts trying out web development. Although this little portfolio website is barebones and does not have that much, I learned a lot along the way. This is my first app using ReactJS which I had to continously look at the docs to put the pieces together. I learned about the React Router, how to utilize Markdown files to create blog posts that interact with React, a bit about website styling, and for now I used a little bit of bootstrap for the navigation bars until I get to making them myself. Overall, fun little project where I can display myself, my projects and some blog posts. Could things look better or could I have done different things, of course. But for now I have a personal website.
