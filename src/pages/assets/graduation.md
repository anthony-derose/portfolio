### my college graduation and what I've been up to. 

In the last couple months I graduated college with a degree in computer science. Four years of learning and having the freedom of being a student has come to an end. It will be a big change going into the real world but I'm excited. I could write endlessly about my experiences and thoughts on college but I want to focus on what I've been up to and my current goals. 

Lately, I've emersed myself in self studying and refreshing myself on data structures, algorithms, computer science problem solving techniques, and doing leetcode problems in order to study for interviews. At this point, I have been seriously trying to find a job for a number of months now sending out many applications and having a ton of interviews at very big name companies. However, I am still on the search for a new graduate software engineering role somewhere I will love to be at. 

An unexpected part of this journey is I never knew how much I enjoy computer science until I started self studying recently. After reviewing and coding a lot and having done around 150 leetcode problems I find myself thinking about doing many more projects that are more theoretical based. I have a much better grasp of coding in general, a much better grasp of Python, and have been much more confident in my abilities. In addition, I started reading algorithms textbooks and getting deeper into computer science. I want to potentially go to graduate school as well after working for a year or two as well. 

I currently don't know what I don't know. 

As a new graduate, I have a breadth of knowledge in different places but I want to find a specific topic I can dive deep in. That's why I have been doing a little of everything from web development to full stack to game development to computer graphics to more theoretical projects lately. My main goal is to find a home that I can settle in for a while and become very knowledgeable there.

Computer Science has really excited me again since graduation and I'm excited to find my niche and a role I can thrive and learn in.
