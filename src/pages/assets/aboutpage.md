### me 

I'd like to think of myself as both a creative person and a logical person. Coding is among many tools that I like to use to create new things and compartmentalize the world. I'm interest in theoretical aspects such as data structures and algorithms and how I can use them to create things in the world. Behond that, lately I've been specificly interested in different areas such as audio, graphics, game development and web development. I want to find my niche inside of computer science and software engineering. 

I believe in making things that are real and tangible. I like being able to see the impacts that my code has on the world.
Whether it is making an audio plugin that makes synth noises or a metronome web app to help me keep time while playing guitar, 
I like seeing a physical representation for the code I write and enjoy being able to personally use my work.
