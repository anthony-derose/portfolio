### me 

I'd like to think of myself as a creative person. Coding is among many tools that I like to use to create new things.
Lately, I've been specificly interested in different areas such as audio, graphics, and web development. Learning how to 
make VST plugins with the JUCE framework with C#, making projects in Unity and reading up on ReactJS to make this website 
have been what has consumed my freetime. 

I believe in making things that are real and tangible. I like being able to see the impacts that my code has on the world.
Whether it is making an audio plugin that makes synth noises or a metronome web app to help me keep time while playing guitar, 
I like seeing a physical representation for the code I write and enjoy being able to personally use my work. 

Upon my graduation, I'm hoping to join an engineering team that aligns with my values and interests and will push and shape me into a better software engineer.
